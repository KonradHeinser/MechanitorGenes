Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

This mod adds 59 new genes that let you create special xenotypes that have portions of their brains dedicated to being excellent mechanitors. Many of the genes that make the carrier a better mechanitor often come at a cost though. Just like how the mechanoid labor enhanced precept limits the pawn's work speed in exchange for improving the work speed of all their mechs, many of these genes will lower another stat based on how much the gene gives. Is a 250% multiplier on mech speed worth losing 60% global work speed? Is the ability to remotely repair or shield your mechs better than any other worth reducing your ability to move quickly?

Most of the negative genes are a 33% and 67% multiplier, except Mech Control, which is 25%, 50%, and 75%. All of the positive genes use 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 225%, and 250%. The stats affected by each category of positive gene are:
Remote Shield: Move Speed
Remote Repair: Move Speed
Repair Speed: Medical Tend and Operation Speed
Mech Control: General Labor, Smelting, and Cleaning Speed
Gestation Speed: Global Learning Rate (Only impacts skills)
Encoding Speed: Research Speed and Meditation Focus Gain(for psychic pawns)
Mech Work Speed: Global Work Speed

Note about work speeds - Global affects all work types, while General only impacts things classified as dumb crafting, along with the speed of quality item crafting. The penalty to global work speed stacks with other work speed penalties.

Note about the innate implants - I know that there is a bug where you can remove the implant, and said implant won't disappear if the original pawn loses the innate implant gene. This is just a bug related to the code behind where it only checks the pawn itself for the implant. While I was not part of the creation process, I assume it was set up this way to avoid potential processing issues in late game.
